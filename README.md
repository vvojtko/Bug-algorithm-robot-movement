# Bug-algorithm-robot-movement

Project made for Robotics and Embedded Systems module. A robot programmed in C language was meant to perform bug-algorithm where it follows a straight line,
avoid obstacles on its way and come back to the line until it reaches a specified point. It contained programmed features such as:  
-Driving and turning  
-Wall outline following  
-Start position and end (M-Line goal)
-Modelling diversion from the M-Line  
-Display the arena information  
-Playing finish song
